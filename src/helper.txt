     POCKET LEAGUE - TOTALLY SERIOUS HELP
==============================================

Welcome to Pocket League.
A game made by a Rocket League fan who clearly had too much free time
and needed a way to "relax" (you won't relax).

----------------------------------------

THE OBJECTIVE (if you can handle it):
Stop the cars from reaching the right side of the field.

If they touch the wall: you're bad.
If they go fast: you're REALLY bad.

Some cars are faster because life is unfair.

If the bot score (on the left) reaches 3:
Congratulations, you lost like a champion.

BUT:
If you destroy a car very close to the final wall,
you magically regain a life because... game design.

----------------------------------------

MENU CONTROLS (try not to mess this up):
Press:
- "1" to choose car 1
- "2" to choose car 2

Choose wisely, it probably won’t matter.

Press "Start" when you feel brave enough.

After you lose, your best score will be displayed
so you can remember how bad you are.

----------------------------------------

IMPORTANT WARNING:
If something breaks, crashes, freezes, or sets your PC on fire:
Open the code and fix it yourself.
I am not tech support.

----------------------------------------

Good luck.
You’ll need it.
